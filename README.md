# Copernicus Emergency Management Service - Wildfire Dataset (2017- 2023)
Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) wildfire dataset from June 2017 to April 2023. The dataset contains Sentinel-2 images associated with wildfires, as well as their corresponding severity and delineation mask. The dataset moreover is enriched with a cloud mask and landcover mask adding more valuable information in future training of a semantic segmentation model.

## Introduction

The **Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS)** is a component of the European Union's Copernicus Programme. It provides prompt geospatial information during emergencies, aiding in response and damage assessment for events such as floods, wildfires, and earthquakes. In particular, **Copernicus Rapid Mapping** provides on-demand mapping services in cases of various natural disasters, offering detailed and up-to-date geospatial information that assists in disaster management and risk assessment. For each activation under tag **Wildfire** are available different post-fire products:
- FEP (First Estimation): It is the first estimation of the burned area.
- DEL (Delineation): It outlines the area affected by the wildfire.
- GRA (Grading): It provides detailed information about the severity of the burned area.

Each product includes metadata and associated JSON files which contain geographical details about the affected areas.

The satellite imagery comes from Sentinel-2, which spans across 12 distinct bands of the light spectrum, each with a resolution of 10 meters. These images are downloaded using the SentinelHub API.

## Data structure and organization

The structure of the dataset is the following:

## Cloud mask

Creating cloud masks before making inferences on Sentinel-2 images is important because clouds can obscure or distort the underlying land cover or land use information that is the focus of the analysis. This can lead to inaccurate or incomplete results. Sentinel-2 images are often used for remote sensing applications, such as monitoring vegetation health, mapping land cover and land use, and detecting changes over time. However, clouds can interfere with these applications by blocking or reflecting the light that is captured by the satellite, which can result in missing or distorted data.

By creating cloud masks, the areas that are affected by clouds can be identified and excluded from future analyses. This ensures that the inferences made from the Sentinel-2 data are based on accurate and reliable information.

By default, all images are retrieved from sentine-hub with the condition of no more than 10 percent of cloud coverage. However some images have a relevant cloud coverage. So it was decided to use cloudSen12 model [5] to create a cloud mask for each image.

The output prediction of CloudSen12 has 4 different layers for cloud coverage:

Label | Class | Class definitions | Color
--- | --- |  --- | ---
0 | `Clear` | Areas where no clouds are found | ![#67BEE0](https://placehold.co/15x15/67BEE0/67BEE0.png)
1 | `Clouds` | Clouds and heavy clouds are present, terrain is obscured and not visible  | ![#DCDCDC](https://placehold.co/15x15/DCDCDC/DCDCDC.png)
2 | `Light clouds` | Areas affected by light clouds, where could cause some issue in the terrain visibility. In this class are included also fog and wildfire's smoke.  | ![#B4B4B4](https://placehold.co/15x15/B4B4B4/B4B4B4.png)
3 | `Shadow` | This areas are in the shadow of the clouds. The terrain is partially/fully visible but the color and some bands of sentinel2 could be changed from real value. | ![#3C3C3C](https://placehold.co/15x15/3C3C3C/3C3C3C.png)

### Smoothing-blend image patches

One challenge of using a U-Net for image segmentation is to have smooth predictions, especially if the receptive field of the neural network is a small amount of pixels [1].
In the context of the U-Net architecture for image segmentation, blending image patches can be used to generate smooth predictions by reducing the effect of discontinuities at patch boundaries.
This approach involves dividing the input image into overlapping patches, running the U-Net architecture on each patch individually, and then blending the resulting predictions together to form a single output image.

By blending the predictions from multiple patches, the resulting output image is typically smoother and more continuous than if a single U-Net model was trained on the entire input image. This can help to reduce artifacts and improve the overall quality of the segmentation results.
In this work the source code of cloudSen12 has been customized so that it could be smoothly predicted. The source code for smooth-blend is available [here](https://github.com/Vooban/Smoothly-Blend-Image-Patches)

## Landcovers

In addition to wildfire delineation mask and clod masks, also landcovers for each image are create. In particular the model considered are: 
- [**ESRI 10m Annual Land Use Land Cover (2017-2021)**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553499&tag=1);
- [**ESRI 2020 Global Land Use Land Cover**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9553499&tag=1);
- [**ESA WorldCover 10 m 2020**](https://esa-worldcover.org/en/data-access).


All landcover models are based on sentinel2 10-meter resolution images.

20 | 1 | `Shrubland` | This class includes any geographic area dominated by natural shrubs having a cover of 10% or more. Shrubs are defined as woody perennial plants with persistent and woody stems and without any defined main stem being less than 5 m tall.
